            Cupertino, California — On a momentous day for the Mac, Apple today
            introduced a new MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini
            powered by the revolutionary M1, the first in a family of chips
            designed by Apple specifically for the Mac. By far the most powerful
            chip Apple has ever made, M1 transforms the Mac experience. With its
            industry-leading performance per watt, together with macOS Big Sur,
            M1 delivers up to 3.5x faster CPU, up to 6x faster GPU, up to 15x
            faster machine learning (ML) capabilities, and battery life up to 2x
            longer than before. And with M1 and Big Sur, users get access to the
            biggest collection of apps ever for Mac. With amazing performance
            and remarkable new features, the new lineup of M1-powered Macs are
            an incredible value, and all are available to order today. “The
            introduction of three new Macs featuring Apple’s breakthrough M1
            chip represents a bold change that was years in the making, and
            marks a truly historic day for the Mac and for Apple,” said Tim
            Cook, Apple’s CEO. “M1 is by far the most powerful chip we’ve ever
            created, and combined with Big Sur, delivers mind-blowing
            performance, extraordinary battery life, and access to more software
            and apps than ever before. We can’t wait for our customers to
            experience this new generation of Mac, and we have no doubt it will
            help them continue to change the world.”

            MacBook Air: A Thin and Light Powerhouse MacBook Air is Apple’s most
            popular Mac and the world’s best-selling 13-inch notebook. With the
            M1 chip, MacBook Air speeds through everything from editing family
            photos to exporting videos for the web. The powerful 8-core CPU
            performs up to 3.5x faster than the previous generation. With up to
            an 8-core GPU, graphics are up to 5x faster, the biggest leap ever
            for MacBook Air, so immersive, graphics-intensive games run at
            significantly higher frame rates. ML workloads are up to 9x faster,
            so apps that use ML-based features like face recognition or object
            detection can do so in a fraction of the time. The M1 chip’s storage
            controller and latest flash technology deliver up to 2x faster SSD
            performance, so previewing massive images or importing large files
            is faster than ever. And in MacBook Air, M1 is faster than the chips
            in 98 percent of PC laptops sold in the past year.1 With the
            industry-leading power efficiency of M1, MacBook Air also delivers
            this performance in a fanless design, which means no matter what
            users are doing, it remains completely silent. And the new MacBook
            Air features extraordinary battery life, with up to 15 hours of
            wireless web browsing and up to 18 hours of video playback — the
            longest battery life ever on a MacBook Air.2
